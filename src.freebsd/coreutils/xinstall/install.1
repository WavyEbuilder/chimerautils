.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file(s) are copied
(or linked if the
.Fl l
option is specified) to the target file or directory.
If the destination is a directory, then the
.Ar file
is copied into
.Ar directory
with its original filename.
If the target file already exists, it is
either renamed to
.Ar file Ns Pa .old
if the
.Fl b
option is given
or overwritten
if permissions allow.
An alternate backup suffix may be specified via the
.Fl B
option's argument.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl B Ar suffix
Use
.Ar suffix
as the backup suffix if
.Fl b
is given.
.It Fl b
Back up any existing files before overwriting them by renaming
them to
.Ar file Ns Pa .old .
See
.Fl B
for specifying a different backup suffix.
.It Fl C
Copy the file.
If the target file already exists and the files are the same,
then do not change the modification time of the target.
If the target's mode needs not to be changed,
the target's inode change time is also unchanged.
.It Fl c
Copy the file.
This is actually the default.
The
.Fl c
option is only included for backwards compatibility.
.It Fl D
Create all leading components of the destination directory except
the last, or all components of
.Fl t ,
before copying.
.It Fl d
Create directories.
Missing parent directories are created as required.
.It Fl g Ar group
Specify a group.
A numeric GID is allowed.
.It Fl l Ar linkflags
Instead of copying the file make a link to the source.
The type of the link is determined by the
.Ar linkflags
argument.
Valid
.Ar linkflags
are:
.Ar a
(absolute),
.Ar r
(relative),
.Ar h
(hard),
.Ar s
(symbolic),
.Ar m
(mixed).
Absolute and relative have effect only for symbolic links.
Mixed links
are hard links for files on the same filesystem, symbolic otherwise.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Specify an alternate mode.
The default mode is set to rwxr-xr-x (0755).
The specified mode may be either an octal or symbolic value; see
.Xr chmod 1
for a description of possible mode values.
.It Fl N Ar dbdir
Use the user database text file
.Pa master.passwd
and group database text file
.Pa group
from
.Ar dbdir ,
rather than using the results from the system's
.Xr getpwnam 3
and
.Xr getgrnam 3
(and related) library calls.
.It Fl o Ar owner
Specify an owner.
A numeric UID is allowed.
Typically this will only work as superuser.
As normal user, a warning will be issued, but it is not a failure.
.It Fl p
Preserve the access and modification times.
Copy the file, as if the
.Fl C
(compare and copy) option is specified,
except if the target file does not already exist or is different,
then preserve the access and modification times of the source file.
.It Fl S
Flush each file to disk after copying.
This has a non-negligible impact on performance, but reduces the risk
of being left with a partial file if the system crashes or loses power
shortly after
.Nm
runs.
.Pp
Historically,
.Fl S
also enabled the use of temporary files to ensure atomicity when
replacing an existing target.
Temporary files are no longer optional.
.It Fl s
.Nm
exec's the command
.Xr strip 1
to strip binaries so that
.Nm
can be portable over a large
number of systems and binary types.
See below for how
.Nm
can be instructed to use another program to strip binaries.
.It Fl t Ar directory
Copy all source arguments into the given
.Ar directory .
.It Fl T
Treat the destination as a normal file.
.It Fl v
Cause
.Nm
to be verbose,
showing files as they are installed or backed up.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility attempts to prevent moving a file onto itself.
.Pp
Installing
.Pa /dev/null
creates an empty file.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The
.Nm
utility checks for the presence of the
.Ev STRIPBIN
environment variable and if present,
uses the assigned value as the program to run if and when the
.Fl s
option has been specified.
.Pp
If the
.Ev DONTSTRIP
environment variable is present,
.Nm
will ignore any specification of the
.Fl s
option.
This is mainly for use in debugging the
.Fx
Ports Collection.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "INS@XXXXXX" -compact
.It Pa INS@XXXXXX
Temporary files named
.Pa INS@XXXXXX ,
where
.Pa XXXXXX
is decided by
.Xr mkstemp 3 ,
are created in the target directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
Historically
.Nm
moved files by default.
The default was changed to copy in
.Fx 4.4 .
.Pp
This version in chimerautils is altered to use GNU-compatible
arguments for
.Fl D T t
except when invoked as
.Ar binstall
which preserves the original semantics, which are not documented here.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chgrp 1 ,
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr cp 1 ,
.Xr mv 1 ,
.Xr strip 1 ,
.Xr getgrnam 3 ,
.Xr getpwnam 3 ,
.Xr chown 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The meaning of the
.Fl M
option has changed as of
.Fx 9.2
and it now takes an argument.
Command lines that used the old
.Fl M
will get an error or in rare cases will append logs to the first of
multiple source files rather than installing it.
.Pp
Temporary files may be left in the target directory if
.Nm
exits abnormally.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility with
.Fl v
falsely says a file is copied when
.Fl C
snaps hard links.
